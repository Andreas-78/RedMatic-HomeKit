> RedMatic based HomeKit Addon for the CCU3 and RaspberryMatic

This package isn't meant to be installed manually, it is included in [RedMatic](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/RedMatic)

This Project is in an early development stage and has to be seen as alpha software. Many planned features are not
implemented yet and there are most likely many bugs.
