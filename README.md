# RedMatic HomeKit

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/redmatic-homekit.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/redmatic-homekit)

> HAP-Nodejs based Node-RED nodes to create (bridged) HomeKit Accessories


Has a special node that automatically generates HomeKit accessories for Homematic devices connected via 
[node-red-contrib-ccu](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-ccu) without any need for manual configuration.

This is kind of a sub-project of [RedMatic](https://github.com/rdmtc/RedMatic) but can be used also apart of RedMatic 
and node-red-contrib-ccu. 

Documentation only available in german until now: https://github.com/rdmtc/RedMatic/wiki/Homekit
