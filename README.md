# RedMatic HomeKit

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/redmatic-homekit.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/redmatic-homekit)

> HAP-Nodejs based Node-RED nodes to create (bridged) HomeKit Accessories


Offers special nodes to conveniently (auto-)create HomeKit accessories from Homematic devices connected via 
[node-red-contrib-ccu](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-ccu) and universal Nodes to create arbitrary HomeKit
accessories that can be used with anything available in Node-RED. 

This is kind of a sub-project of [RedMatic](https://github.com/rdmtc/RedMatic) but can be used also apart of RedMatic 
and without node-red-contrib-ccu. 

Documentation only available in german until now: https://github.com/rdmtc/RedMatic/wiki/Homekit
